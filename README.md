This project focuses on building a Retail Sales Forecasting System that predicts future sales based on historical data. The system includes:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
2. A machine learning model for sales forecasting.
3. A Power BI dashboard for visualizing insights and trends.
4. Comprehensive reporting and evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data, predict future sales using machine learning, and provide actionable insights through visualizations and reports. The system is designed to help businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding sales trends, profit margins, and regional performance.

Key components include:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw sales data.
- Forecasting Model: Predicting sales using a trained machine learning model.
- Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visualizations for sales trends, profit margins, and regional performance.
- Reporting: Generating detailed reports summarizing insights and model performance.

## Features

### Data Pipeline:
- Load, clean, and preprocess raw sales data.
- Handle missing values and create new features (e.g., Order Year, Profit Margin).

### Machine Learning:
- Train a forecasting model to predict sales based on features like Order Month and Profit Margin.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Power BI Dashboard:
- Visualize sales trends, profit margins, and regional performance.
- Compare actual vs. predicted sales.

### Reporting:
- Generate text-based and PDF reports summarizing insights and model performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Power BI Desktop (for the dashboard)
